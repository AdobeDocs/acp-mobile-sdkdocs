Support for Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network

The Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs support data collection and other features via the Edge Network. <br/><br/> The new [Experience Platform Edge Network](#) extension is now available for Android and iOS. This extension, alongside many others, can help you take advantage of functionality provided by [Adobe Journey Optimizer](https://business.adobe.com/products/journey-optimizer/adobe-journey-optimizer.html) and [Adobe Experience Platform](https://business.adobe.com/products/experience-platform/adobe-experience-platform.html).

## Bring the Adobe Experience Cloud to your apps

The Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK helps power Adobe's Experience Cloud solutions and services in your mobile apps.

The SDK is comprised of the Mobile Core and a series of modular Adobe Experience Cloud solutions or third-party vendor extensions that depend on the Mobile Core. Extensions interact with the Mobile Core to provide features specific to the solution or service they represent.

Experience Platform Mobile SDKs are available for Android, iOS, and a variety of cross-platform development frameworks. SDKs configuration is managed through the Data Collection UI for flexible configuration and extensible, rules-based integrations.
